# clubhouseCRM
Membership management CRM application for small to midsized clubs and organizations.  This is a project for 2017 Fall semester of CSCI466.

## starting the application

ClubhouseCRM is a spring-boot app. To start it, run the jar like so:
```
java -jar clubhouse-crm-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
This starts the application running in an embedded Apache Tomcat server. The default deployment exposes the app over port 8080. This can be reconfigured by modifying the scr/main/resources/application.yml. To access the web UI, enter localhost:8080 in your browser.
